# To-Do-List
## This was made as part of The Odin Project course. Here I learned to organize code into separate modules to increase code readability and maintainability. I also learned to verify forms using the constraint validation API.
### This project includes:
#### "Task Lists" which organize user's tasks by selected criteria
#### "Add task" form to add new tasks. Form was built with Constraint Validation API.
##### When user presses the 'Add Task' button, the form is verified. If input is correct and such task (i. e. task with the same title) does not already exist, the task is added.
#### Each task can be removed by pressing the 'Remove Task' button. It completely removes the task both from the HTML document and from the container which stores all the user's tasks.
